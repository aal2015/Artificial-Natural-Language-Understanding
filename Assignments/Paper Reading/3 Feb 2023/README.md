| ------------- | ------------- |
| Issue | Currently, all GEC systems process each sentence independently. However, document-level context may be needed to correct certain errors (e.g. present or past tense). Also, processing at the sentence level may lead to inconsistent modifications throughout whole document. |
| Solution | Incorporate document-level context |
| Contributions | <ol><li>Propose document-level GEC systems</li> <li>Employ three-step training strategy</li> <li>Compare with NMT-based models for document-level context evalutation</li></ol> |
| Model | Sentence level (baseline): encoder-decoder transformer </br> Document-context level: (1) Single Encoder Model, (2) Multi-encoder encoder side, (3) Multi-encoder decoder side |
| Single-encoder Model | Same architecture as the baseline model for sentence level. However, the difference is that this model considers context by concatenating previous sentence(s) to current sentence.
| Multi-encoder Models | Has an extra encoder to process the current sentence and its context separately. The resulting context from two encoders can be integrated in the encoder side and decoder side hence leading to two models based on this. |
